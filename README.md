'Vertical_Limit' Emulation Station Theme - By Dwayne Hurst March 2019
For best results, use transition style = Instant

This theme is designed for a vertical Pi set up. 16:9 1920x1080 screen rotated 90 or 270 degrees.
Edit the config.txt file in boot and add 'display_rotate=3' (or 1 depending on which way you rotate screen).

Cheers
